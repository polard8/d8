	How can the UI in Gramado 1.0 be improved? 	

	... this question is gonna guide me.
	For now, all we have is a DOS-like command interpreter and 
some adventures on an interface with windows.
	I will work to expand this usability, given to the 
command interpreter more power and tools. At the same time we can 
give access to the well consolidated graphical components.

	Core elements:
	task bar: The anchor.       
	Program launcher and task switcher.
