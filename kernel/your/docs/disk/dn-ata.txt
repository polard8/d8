Gramado OS: Version 1.7 Build 315.
ata:
Critical changes on ata driver.
Now we're support the index for the ata ports
and the index for the ide ports.
Each port has its own struct and set of data.
Some operations uses the port number affecting
a given device.
For now the configuration header file gives us the default
ide port and we can operate only over this one device.
There is a lot to do yet to handle this port thing.
But now i decide to give the indexes a chance.
If something goes wrong use the saved in this date.
