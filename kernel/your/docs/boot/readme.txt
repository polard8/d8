 In this folder you can find the 'startup code' and the 'entry code'. Both
cases are found in the same Assembly code.

 + The 'startup code' is the code in Assembly when the kernel is initializing.
 + The 'entry code' is the code in Assembly when the execution is reentering 
   the kernel via syscall or exception.

--------------------------------
startup/
 The beginning of the Assembly contain the kernel initialization for 64bit 
and the rest of the code contain code for the entry code, when the execution 
came from ring3 to ring 0 via exception or syscall. 

--------------------------------
entry/
 We're using the folders hw/ and sw/ to separate the cases where the entry 
is generated by exceptions or syscalls.
