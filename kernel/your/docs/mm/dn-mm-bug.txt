i just found a bug.
My allocator was using pre-allocated pages 
from a wrong region in the memory.
The allocator needs to use only 512 pages on a region 
of pre-allocated ring 3 shared memory.
but the allocator was using 1024 pages on this region ...
it means that the allocator was stealing memory 
from another kernel component.
the system was not crashing with this bug ... 
because maybe the allocator was stealing memory from a non-critical region.
-----
fixed the bug, the allocator is less powerful and 
now i can launch less applications.
2 or 3 processes ... only.
the job now is working in the memory management 
to get more memory for the processes.
----
it is because the system only is able to map memory in chuncks of 2mb. 
this is all we can map with a single page table.
i need a routine when i can iterate that job and map multiple regions of 2mb. 
using multiple pagetables.
-----
so, all i have for now is two allocators .... 
one heap with 1mb of ring0 memory and 
a pagepool with 512 pre-allocated ring3 shared memory.
