   Design note: Ring3 applications:
   Gramado is able to run two types of ring3 applications:

+ The unix-like commands using the standard libc and 
  printing in the kernel console, 
  using the fullscreen raw console.
  see: core/commands/
+ And the gui applications ... 
  using the client-side library and the libc.
  see: userland/ventana/apps/
