
 Testing with USE_E1000 flag selected in config.h:

----------------------
On Virtualbox:
 It works if we use PIIX3 for the system and for the IDE.
But sometimes we face some Page Fault. Probably we are receiving 
a lot of interrupts during the initialization. If the initialization 
works fine, then we can test the network support with the commands net-on and n3.
 It was easier with the resolution 640x480.
 It doesn't work with ICH9.

----------------------
On qemu:
 It doesn't work.
 And the system crashes when trying to launch any ring3 application,
'cause we are out of memory.
