  AF_GRAMADO

  This is domain used by the system server on 
  Gramado OS.

--------------------------------------
AF_UNIX / AF_LOCAL
    This family is used in the local context.
    The structure accepts a pathname as an address.
    It doesn't have and IP:Port socket.
    It accepts only clients that belongs to this domain.

    This structure is found is sys/socket.h.
    struct sockaddr 
    {
        unsigned short sa_family;
        char           sa_data[14];
    };

    This structure is found is sys/socket.h.
    #define UNIX_PATH_MAX  108
    struct sockaddr_un
    {
        uint16_t sun_family;
        char sun_path[UNIX_PATH_MAX];
    };

--------------------------------------
AF_INET
    This family is used in the remote context as well as in
    the local context.
    The structure accepts a socket, with IP:Port.
    It accepts only clients that belongs to this domain.

    The structure is found is sys/un.h
    struct sockaddr_in 
    {
        // len + family = 16bit
        uint8_t           sin_len;      // 8
        sa_family_t       sin_family;   /* 8 address family: AF_INET */
        in_port_t         sin_port;     /* port in network byte order */ 
        struct in_addr    sin_addr;     /* internet address */
        __int8_t          sin_zero[8];
    };

--------------------------------------
AF_GRAMADO
    This family is mid-term between AF_UNIX and AF_INET,
    it accepts a string with two chars as server identifier,
    but the kernel associate a number of port to a pair of char.
    Each pair of char has a number of port associated with them.
    The system has a small number of pair of chairs. Only for the
    basic system server.
    It uses the same structures of AF_UNIX, or a new one 
    called sockaddr_gram, and we put the pair of chars 
    into the data area reserved for pathnames.
    Ex: 'ws', 'ns', 'xx' ...
    it accepts clients from different domains, AF_GRAMADO, AF_UNIX and 
    even AF_INET, because the kernel associates a port with address.

    This structure is found is sys/socket.h.
    struct sockaddr 
    {
        unsigned short sa_family;
        char           sa_data[14];
    };

    This structure is found is sys/socket.h.
    #define UNIX_PATH_MAX  108
    struct sockaddr_un
    {
        uint16_t sun_family;
        char sun_path[UNIX_PATH_MAX];
    };

    This structure is found is sys/socket.h.
    struct sockaddr_gram
    {
        unsigned short sa_family;
        char           sa_data[14];
    };
