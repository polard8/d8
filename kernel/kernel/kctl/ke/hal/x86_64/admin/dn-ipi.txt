    Sending IPIs
    
    IPIs are sent through the BSP's LAPIC. 
Find the LAPIC base address from the MP tables or ACPI tables, 
then you can write 32-bit words to base + 0x300 and base + 0x310 to send IPIs. 
For a init IPI or startup IPI, you must first write 
the target LAPIC ID into bits 24-27 of base + 0x310. 
Then, for an init IPI, write 0x00004500 to base + 0x300. 
For a SIPI, write 0x00004600, ored with the page number at which 
you want to AP to start executing, to base + 0x300.
