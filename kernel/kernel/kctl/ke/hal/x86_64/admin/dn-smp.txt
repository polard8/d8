    The SMP support.
    The APIC/IOAPIC initialization.

---------------------------------------
In x64init.c:

The function I_init() in x64init.c call x64_probe_smp() to check 
for SMP support. After that I_init() calls lapic_initializing()
to setup lapic support using the address we found. This routine 
is found in apic.c. 

If this attempt fails, 
I_init() calls x64_probe_smp_via_acpi() to try the lapic initialization 
using the default address.
The function x64_probe_smp_via_acpi() in x64.c call lapic_initializing()
to setup lapic support. This routine is found in apic.c.
