 FRED support.
 (Flexible Return and Event Delivery)
 
 In order to support the FRED technology we gotta do some code in Assembly 
handling the reentry to ring 0 called by a process in ring 3 via FRED. 
 It sounds kinda like the SYSCALL function, but it needs to handle stacks 
and kinds of stacks, jusk like ghost stacks i guess.
