	Kernel-mode callable interfaces.
	These functions are wrappers for the kernel-mode service
implementation.
	These are the prefixes used for now.
	#todo: We need a better standard for that.
-------------
sys_xxxxx:
	These routines are called by the syscalls 0x80 and 0x82.
	See: 
	sys.c 
	zcall/sys/sci0.h 
	zcall/sys/sci1.h 
	zcall/sys/sci2.h
	zcall/sys/syscalls.h 
------------
zero_xxxxx:
	These routines are called during the kernel initialization.
	Maybe we need a better name for this prefix. zi_xxxx maybe.
	see: 
	zero.c 
	zcall/zero/zero.h
------------
newos_xxxx:
	These are callable kernel0mode interface.
	These routines are used by the kernel, but maybe 
	they can be used by the ring0 modules.
	see: 
	zcall/newos/newos.h 
	sci.c

-----------------
#todo
    Each one of these prefixes needs 
    to have its own folder, where we're gonna
    put the files where we have the apis.
