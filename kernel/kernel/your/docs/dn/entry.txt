 Let's talk about the moments when the execution is entering 
in the base kernel in ring 0. It happens in three situations:
 + During the kernel initialization when the bootloader passes the 
   control to the kernel and it starts at the entrypoint.
 + When a hardware interrupt starts the execution of a handler in ring0.
 + When a software interrupt just like systemcalls starts the execution 
   of a handler in ring 0. Remember, there are some other methods in this case,
   just like SYSENTER and FRED.

--------------------------------
kctl/arch/x86_64/startup/:
  Here You can find the entrypoint and the initialization routine.

--------------------------------
kctl/arch/x86_64/entry/:
  Here You can find the moments where the execution re-start in ring0,
  right after an interrupt event. The hw/ folder is for hardware interrupts and 
  the sw/ is for software interrupts.
