   bugfix:
   Now the initialization routes are kinda similar
   and the initialization is not affecting the window server anymore.

------------------

    The way we initialize the GUI mode is affecting the 
    window server in 64bit.

    It works when we initialize the gui after the 32bit shell.
    If we initialize the gui directly without entering in the shell
    so, the window server will fail.

    Something is right with the gui initialization after the shell
    and something is wrong with the gui initialization without 
    entering the shell.

; #BUGBUG 
; Suspended!!!!
; Something is affecting the window server,
; if we enter in the graphics mode without entering
; the shell first. There are two routines 
; to initialize the gui mode. Only one is good.
