    Note about the PS2/Mouse implementation and usage.

For now, I do not fully initialize the ps2 embedded driver 
at the kernel initialization. I only initialize the ps2 keyboard. 

To test the ps2-mouse, i'm following these steps: 
>> [control+f9] to enter into a kernel mode embedded shell, 
and then type the command 'ps2-qemu' to fully initialize 
the ps2 support for qemu architecture, 
>> [control+f10] to go out of the shell. ... 

when in the ring3 shell we can type:
>>'wsq' to initialize the GUI ,,, and after that, 
>> [shitft+f12] to enable the mouse usage.
