  #todo:
  The goal of this document is explain how to use the 
Desktop Environment.

=============
Keyboard:
  The PS2 keyboard is always initialized during the kernel initialization 
and we can type commands using the keyboard.

=============
Mouse:
  The PS2 mouse is NOT initialized during the kernel initialization 
and we need initialize it to test the mouse. Normally we initialize the mouse support
just typing a command the will fully reinitialize the PS2 controller.

ex: 
- Press [shift+12] after the full GUI initialization.
- Type 'ps2-qemu' in the kernel mode command line interpreter.
You can enter into this interpreter just pressing [control+f9] and leave it 
pressing [control+f10].
