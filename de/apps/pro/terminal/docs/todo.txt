 The terminal window is a window that fits into the client are 
of the main window of the application.
 What is happening it that when we move the position of the main window 
the terminal window does not fit into the client area anymore.
 Probably the terminal needs to receive a event from the server 
and update the position of the terminal window after probing 
the information about the client area of the main window.
