Facing issues with [editbox windows].

  When we destroy the editor.bin/gdm applications it remains the client_window
undestroyed (editbox window), so if we click with the mouse on this window, the wm will
setup an invalid window with focus and setup an invalid foreground thread.
Or simply the kernel is destroying the application but it is not
updating the current foreground thread.
