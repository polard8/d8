   Changing the value in listen(.) from 4 to 8.

--------------

    Quando lança o quinto aplicativo, entao 
    o primeiro deles para de receber eventos.
    Mesmo quando as aplicaçoes nao sao todas graficas.
    5 + init + ws. = 7.
    Quando lança 5, a primeira lançada nao consegue
    pegar eventos no servidor.

---------

	When closing the last application window in a lot of 5 windows.

	When we launch 5 windows, we're unable to close the last one.
	+ The woutine is sending the CLOSE message to the window.
	but nothing is happening, and the app can't get the message.
	+ The application's thread is still running, but is unable to
	get the message.

	Maybe we're sending message to the wrong window. But we're 
	sending message to a valid overlapped window.
