    How the dispatcher works?

    The main() function calls the on_execute() function
    to do the real job.
    The function on_execute() stay in a loop accepting connections.

    When it gets a valid connection, so it calls the dispacher() function 
    to handle the request. The information about the request is found 
    inside the client's socket that is file read via read() function.
    After reading this file, the dispacher() function will call the 
    gwsProcedure() function to handle the information found inside this file.
    The information inside this file follow a protocol called Gramado Protocol.
    There is an important information inside this file, that is the Index 
    of the service. It represents the number of the service that the server
    needs to execute. So, gwsProcedure() will call this service given this index.

    In some cases the routine needs to send a response to the client,
    putting some information inside the file and updating the
    synchronization status in the file. Some of the requests do not need
    a response.

    After that the function can return and come back to the loop
    found in on_excute(), looking for the next valid connection.
