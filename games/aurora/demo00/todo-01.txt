
Create a funcion to draw 3D cubes for us.

We're drawing the cube based on a static model
given all the dots of this model.
We need to create a function that will draw 3D cubes.
The position of the cube depends on the camera position,
and the position of the cube, normally the position of the cube
is represented by a dot in the center of the cube. 
We need to know if the system is right-handed or left-handed for the z axis,
and we need to know if we are using perspective or not. When we're using perspective,
we need to have a vanishing point.
We have 'perspective' and 'orthographic' camera projections, where the 
perspective has a vanishing point.

Rotations:
Remember, we can rotate the model, we can rotate the scene and 
we also can move the camera.
